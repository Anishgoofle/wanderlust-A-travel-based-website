<p Align="left">  <br>  The English loanword "wanderlust" was already extant in the German</br><br> language dating as far back as Middle High German.</br>
<br>The first documented use of the term in English occurred in 1902 </br><br>as a reflection of what was then seen as a characteristically</br><br> German predilection for wandering that may be traced back to </br><br>German Romanticism and the German system of apprenticeship (the journeyman),</br><br> as well as the adolescent custom of the 'Wanderbird' seeking unity with Nature.
</br><br>The term originates from the German words wandern (to hike) and Lust (desire).</br>
<br>The term wandern,does in fact not mean "to wander", but "to hike."</br>
<br>Placing the two words together, translated: "enjoyment of hiking",</br><br> 
 although it is commonly described as an enjoyment of strolling, </br><br>roaming about or wandering.</br>
<br>In modern German, the use of the word Wanderlust to mean "desire to travel" 
 is less common,</br><br> having been replaced by Fernweh (lit. "farsickness"), coined as an antonym to Heimweh ("homesickness").</br>
